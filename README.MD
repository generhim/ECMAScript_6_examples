# ECMAScript 6 Examples

The purpose of this repository is to list different aspects of ECMAScript 6, and to provide working examples. 
Think of it as a notes repo where there are numerous .MD files in order to explain different parts of ECMAScript 6 and to list where to find the examples. 

# Why this repository? 

##.) Because having working examples is often times the best sort of teaching tool one can provide.
##.) Making this repo cements the author's own understanding of the ECMAScript standard.
